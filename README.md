# Songs Organizer
Desktop application made with C# Windows Forms (.Net Framework)

<b>Main features:</b>
- Allows user to store information about their favorite music.<br/>
- The app consits of main workspace inside which user can open multiple windows showing stored songs in a table.<br/> 
- Songs might be added/edited with a dialogue window (includes data validation and custom created control for choosing genre) or deleted.<br/>
- Every window has an independent data filter (e.g. 'window A' shows songs released after year 2000 while 'window B' shows those released before year 2000).<br/>
- After modifying any song data in one of the displayed windows, the same data (and only that data, not the whole list) 
in other windows gets refreshed as well (while keeping filter settings).<br/>
- Custom created control allows for more attractive music genre selection, by clicking on an image representation of particular genre user can scroll through sequence of those.
